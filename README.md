# RSA-signature
This C++ project implements a digital signature system based on the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) public-key cryptosystem. The project utilizes the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm to organize and encapsulate key components of the digital signature process.

Features
Key Generation: The project includes a key generation mechanism for generating RSA key pairsâ€”public and private keys.

Digital Signature Creation: It provides a function to create a digital signature for a given message using the private key.

Signature Verification: The project includes functionality to verify the authenticity of a signature using the corresponding public key.
